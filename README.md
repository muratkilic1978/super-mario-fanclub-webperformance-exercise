## Web-Performance Optimization

### Use Chrome Dev Tools and the Lighthouse Tool to Optimize the Super Mario Fanclub Site

In this exercise, you will explore Chrome Dev Tools to see how they can assist in building optimized websites. You will learn more about the following topics:

- Analyze the fanclub website’s loading time using Lighthouse within Google Chrome’s Inspect Tool for Mobile, and write down the current performance score.
- Optimize all images and convert them to the webp format.
- Check the image quality for each optimized image, and repeat the optimization if the quality is not satisfactory.
- Run the Lighthouse performance test again (according to step 1) and verify that the performance score is 90 or above.
